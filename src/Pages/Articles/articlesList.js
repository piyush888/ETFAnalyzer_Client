          "ETFTrace software is a complete package for analyzing arbitrage in ETF industry. ETF is balanced by process of Creation/Redemption by a designated market maker for ETF provider. Due to market inefficiencies an ETF is not always balanced & is like a swinging pendulum. We have combined signals when an ETF is Over Bough/Sold with Candle stick patterns, resulting in  quiet profitable trading strategy. We would like to share these results with you here.",

        paragraph:
          "A hammer candlestick pattern is seen when a candlestick with a short body and long lower wick is formed. It is usually found at the bottom of a downward price trend. Whenver a hammer pattern occurs we check the magnitude of arbitrage for the ETF & informs the trader, via signals, to either buy if ETF is heavily discounted or (green arrow) or hold if ETF is very close to NAV, thus increasing accuracy.",

          "Arbitrage, roughly, means to take advantage of different pricing of the same asset - securities, commodities, or currency, in different markets or forms to make some profit.

Net Asset Value is the ideal trading price calculated by taking the volume-weighted price of underlying holdings of an ETF. Net Asset Value and, subsequently, Arbitrage in $ are calculated using the following formulae:",
